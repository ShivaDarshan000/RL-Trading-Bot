# RL-Trading-Bot
This project teaches an AI trader to decide when to Buy, Sell, or Hold stocks using past price data.

🔍 How It Works
Input: Give it a stock price history file (CSV).
Training: The AI learns by practicing 1000 times, figuring out which actions make the most profit.
Testing: After training, it simulates trading and shows its decisions on a price chart.

📊 What You See
✅ Green dots = Buy signal
❌ Red dots = Sell signal
📉 No dots = Hold (do nothing)
💰 Final Profit/Loss = How much money it made (or lost)
